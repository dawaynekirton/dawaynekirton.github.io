<p><B>Make Your Own Korean Silk Worms</B></p>
     <ol>
          <li>To eliminate the off flavor, drain the canned beondegi then soak for 1 hour in cold water.</li>
          <li>Drain and repeat the process two more times</li>
          <li>After the last soak pat dry with paper towel</li>     
          <li>Next, marinade the beondegi in a sauce made from 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and 2 finely minced garlic cloves</li>
          <li>Allow the beondegi to marinate for 30 minutes</li>
          <li>Separately, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat your oven to 400° F / 205° C</li>
     	  <li>Drain the beondegi of excess marinade and evenly scatter on the baking sheet</li>
          <li>Place in the oven and roast 45-60 minutes or until light and crisp</li>
          <li>Give the baking sheet a shake every 10 minutes or so to ensure even roasting</li>
	  <li>When done, sprinkle to taste with salt</li>

<p><B>Make Your Own Escargot</B></p>
     <ol>
          <li><B>Use a sharp knife to cut away the membrane</B> covering the openings of the shells, if you're using fresh snails. Cover the snails in about 3 inches of cold water mixed with 1/4 cup of salt for every 25 to 30 snails.</li>
          <li><B>Soak the snails for about 4 hours, changing the water and rinsing the shells</B> when you see greenish mucus or white froth building up on the surface. Discard any snails that float.</li>
          <li><B>Boil the snails in fresh water for about 10 minutes, skimming the froth from the water</B> as it appears, and transfer them to a bowl filled with ice water.</li>
	  <li><B>Pick the snails out of the shell using a skewer and trim off the intestine,</B> the greenish-black protrusion attached to the bodies. Rinse the snails in a colander under cool running water and place them in a shallow dish lined with cornmeal.</li>
          <li><B>Rub the snails between your palms and fingers with cornmeal</B> to remove the last vestiges of mucus.</li>
          <li><B>Rinse the shells under cool running water while rubbing your fingers over them to clean them</B> and allow them to air dry.</li>
	  <li><B>Fill a pot with lightly salted water and simmer the snails until tender, about 1 hour</B> for small snails and 2 hours for meaty snails. Rinse the snails under cold running water and place them on a towel to drain and dry.</li>
          <li><B>Rinse the brine from canned snails</B>, if you are using them, with running water and set aside.</li>
          <li><B>Make a compound butter by combining room-temperature butter with aromatics and herbs.</B> Escargot prepared in the style of Burgundy uses compound butter made of freshly chopped parsley, a drizzle of white wine, minced shallots, minced garlic, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, but you can use any herbs you like. Place the butter in a bowl and let it firm up in the refrigerator.</li>
     	  <li><B>Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour about 1 inch of salt or dry beans in a shallow baking dish.</B> The salt or beans will hold the shells with the opening pointing upwards so the butter won't spill during cooking.</li>
	  <li><B>Insert the snails into their shells. Scoop a spoonful of cold compound butter into the shell openings</B> and position the shells opening-side-up in the salt or beans.</li>
          <li><B>Roast the snails until sizzling, about 5 or 6 minutes.</B> Remove the dish and serve the escargot on an escargot tray with escargot tongs and forks.
